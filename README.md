# Hello World!!! 

### My name is Andrew Oberthaler. I am an American-born data scientist with over 15 years of experience applying algorithms of all types in the marketing, energy, transport, and environmental sectors.
### I have created this page primarily for self-learning, but also to showcase some of my work which is not proprietary.  I try to keep it updated to the best of ability, but depending on my time restrictions, there are various levels of dedication to maintenance of these pages.

### There are three main project headings which you will find in these repositories, they are:

## Quick Python Programming Challenges
### This repository consists of a number of self-solved codility challenges which test abililty to quickly understand and solve basic algorithms in python syntax.

## Kaggle Challenges and Datasets
### This repository consists of interesting Kaggle datasets and challenges which I have analyzed/predicted and scored within the top 5 percent.

## Own Projects (WIP)
### Contains some of my own projects and topics which I find interesting for prediction.
